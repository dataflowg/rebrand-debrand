# rebrand-debrand
Brings the classic NI blue and Nigel the eagle back to ni.com

![NI Blue Theme](./ni-blue-theme-forum.png?raw=true "NI Blue Theme")

## Why Debrand?
It's not so much about debranding, as it is making ni.com more visually accessible. With the green theme, links and other items are much harder to see. The choice to use a very dark green against a white background is also visually fatiguing, especially when reading the forums and online documentation.

Also I missed Nigel.

## Installation
This theme requires on the [Stylus browser plugin](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). After installing it, use it to create a new style, then and copy and paste the contents of [ni-blue-theme.css](https://github.com/dataflowg/rebrand-debrand/raw/master/ni-blue-theme.css) into the style. Give it a name, save it, and that's it!
